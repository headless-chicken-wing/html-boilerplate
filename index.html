    <h1>Yet <i>Another</i> Hello World Example</h1>
    
      <p> One thing I don't quite get sometimes is what or how where a long sentence decides to break.<br>
        I'm sure this has something to do with width, but right now (for example) I'm writing this<br>
        "paragraph" or run-on sentence if you will inside of a terminal where line length matters not.<br>
        For that reason I'm intentionally blabbing away as this is all experimental anyway and I am<br>
        curios to see how the browser decides to split this line based only on my 'p' tags.<br>
      </p>  
    <h1>Let's find out...</h1> 
      
      <p>Insert something interesting here</p>
    

    <h2>What I learned...</h2>

      <p><b>Well, askutchullay...</b> For readabilty inside my terminal <i>(keeping it simple for now and using Nano as my IDE)</i>,<br>
         the never ending long line doesn't work for these reasons:</p><br>
      <ol>
      <li>first reason</li>
      <li>second reason</li>
      </ol>
